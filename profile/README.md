**ReverseClinic** is a **non-profit organization** based in **Seattle, WA**, focused on supporting **academic research** in software analysis and reverse engineering.  
Our work brings together **tools**, **practices**, and **communities** that aim to deepen understanding of how software behaves, changes, and interacts across different platforms and contexts.

We develop and maintain open-source projects that facilitate:

- Program instrumentation and runtime inspection  
- Binary analysis and system behavior exploration  
- Research-driven experimentation in software security and interoperability  
- Analysis of software protection and obfuscation techniques  
- Evaluation of debugging, tracing, and sandboxing methods  
- Tooling for exploring system internals and low-level architecture

Our work supports academic inquiry into how software behaves, evolves, and defends itself across platforms.  
Projects are guided by principles of **responsible disclosure**, **technical transparency**, and **non-commercial educational use**.

ReverseClinic aims to foster a research-oriented environment that encourages **curiosity**, **integrity**, and **collaborative learning** in the study of software systems.
