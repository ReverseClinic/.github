# ReverseClinic Code of Conduct

## Scope of Application

This Code of Conduct applies to all repositories under this organization. Any exceptions or modifications will be explicitly stated in the respective repository.

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of the ReverseClinic, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability (visible or invisible), ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity, or orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community, supporting both academic and professional collaboration.


## Our Standards

### Positive Behaviors

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy, kindness, and patience toward others
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing for mistakes, learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best for the overall community and research mission
- Welcoming and supporting people of all backgrounds and identities, including but not limited to: race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability
- Understanding and appreciating diverse perspectives, especially in research and technical discussions

### Unacceptable Behaviors

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments; personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment, including repeated or unwanted contact
- Doxing (posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information)
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit permission
- Discriminatory jokes, violent threats, or language directed at another person
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviors
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or academic setting


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, project discussions, mailing lists, chat channels, events, and any other forums managed by ReverseClinic. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the organization in public spaces (e.g., using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events).

Violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within our community.


## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, or other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.


## Reporting Violations

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, please report it by emailing [reverseclinic@proton.me](mailto:reverseclinic@proton.me). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of reporters of any incident.


## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces and external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.


## Disagreements and Resolution

Disagreements, both social and technical, happen frequently in research and open-source collaboration. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively and respectfully. Focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes, rather than blaming others.

Remember that our strength comes from our diverse, global community and varied perspectives. If you cannot understand why someone holds a viewpoint, seek to understand their reasoning and context.
